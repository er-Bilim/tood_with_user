# 📝 Todo App – Practice Repository

> ⚠️ **This is an educational repository** This code is written solely for practice and to explore technologies

A simple REST API application **Todo with users**. Each user can register, log in, and manage their tasks.

The goal is to practice:

- Working with **Mongoose** (schemas, models, methods)
- Proper **architecture** and query structure
- **Password hashing** using `argon2`

**Best practices for controllers:**
- Always wrap in `try/catch`
- Return clear status codes (`200`, `201`, `400`, `404`, `500`)
- Don't write business logic directly in routes

## 🔐 Password Hashing

The `argon2` library is used
